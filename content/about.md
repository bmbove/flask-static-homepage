About
-----

My name is Brian Bove. I'm an engineer based in Portland, Oregon.
I graduated from [Oregon State University](http://www.oregonstate.edu) in 2016 
with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and I also earned  B.S. in 
Physics from the [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu) [2010].

For work, I enjoy circuit design, control systems, and software development 
(embedded, OS, scripting, and application). I'm currently self-employed, running 
UFM Systems LLC, at the moment focusing on developing low-power, 
"connected" devices for long term monitoring, data logging, and control systems. 
I'm always seeking new projects and opportunities, so if you're interested in 
working with me, please take a look at my resume, projects, and my code on 
[github](http://www.github.com/bmbove "github - bmbove").

Outside of work, I'm a tinkerer and hobbyist. I'm hands-on and have a passion 
for DIY, probably to a fault. On a given day I might be a programmer, 
electrician, carpenter, mechanic, welder, gardener, and chef. Like everyone else
in Oregon, I spend time enjoying the outdoors when I can.
