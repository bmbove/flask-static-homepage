About
-----

My name is Brian Bove. I'm enrolled in the electrical engineering and computer
science program at [Oregon State University](http://www.oregonstate.edu), and
will graduate in Spring 2016 with a bachelor's degree. I graduated from the
[University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu) in 2010 with a B.S. in physics.
I enjoy circuit design, control systems, and software development (embedded,
OS, scripting, and application). I'm currently self-employed, running UFM
Systems LLC, focusing on server management and python-based backend web
development. I'm seeking employment opportunities, and if you're interested in
hiring me, please take a look at my resume, projects,
and my code on [github](http://www.github.com/bmbove "github - bmbove").

As far as on-campus activities go, I'm the electrical team lead on a project
building an electric vehicle to compete in the
[Shell Eco-marathon](http://www.shell.com/global/environment-society/ecomarathon.html).
The vehicle will be driven by a brushless motor, and the controller must be
purpose-built for the competition. In addition to the motor controller, the
electrical team is responsible for handling vehicle telemetry and test-bench
setups for efficiency measurements. 

I've also worked as a TA on campus over the past few terms, teaching electrical 
fundamentals to general engineering students. I especially enjoy the lab 
portions of the courses, because the core challenge of engineering is at play:
"can you build it?". I've never been the pencil-pusher type, so having students
design and build circuits based on concepts they've learned in the classroom
is, by far, the most interesting part of the job. 

Off-campus and outside of work, I'm a tinkerer and hobbyist, usually having a
dozen projects going at a time and covering as many topics. I'm a programmer, 
electrician, carpenter, mechanic, welder, gardener, and chef. I like to stay
active and in decent shape, so I'm at the gym a handful of times a week, and
though I'm not particularly fond of it, I run a few miles a week as well. I
enjoy the outdoors, and when I can, I get away to go hiking, camping, hunting,
and fishing.
