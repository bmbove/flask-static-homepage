Welcome
-------

My name's Brian Bove. I have a B.S. in Physics from the
[University at Buffalo](http://www.physics.buffalo.edu/), and I'm currently
completing a second B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at
[Oregon State University](http://engineering.oregonstate.edu). I'm expected to
graduate in June 2016, and I'm currently seeking career and internship
opportunities while I finish my degree.
