Welcome

My name's Brian Bove. I have a B.S. in Physics from the
[University at Buffalo](http://www.physics.buffalo.edu/), and have recently
completed a second B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at
[Oregon State University](http://engineering.oregonstate.edu). I'm currently 
seeking career and contracting opportunities.
