title: New Website, Python and Django
date: 2013-12-15 22:58:23.312341

I've owned this domain for a few years now but haven't done much with it besides use it as a test platform for various projects. A friend of mine recently overhauled his personal website and did an excellent job creating what amounts to an online resume and portfolio, so using his site for inspiration, I decided to put together my own. Mostly I'd like to start documenting projects that I'm working on, as I usually have something interesting that I'm toying with but always fail to document it.

Though this site doesn't look like much, the backend is somewhat over-engineered. The past month or so, I've been working on a contract building a site using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/ "Django") as the framework. I've been doing contract web development for about 3 years, though nearly all in PHP. While I think PHP is a much more powerful scripting language than people give it credit for, Python is the go-to language in many fields and is just so clean compared to PHP that I decided to dedicate more time to getting a better grip on it. So, with this contract, I decided to dive right in and go with Django. Though this site would be fine with just serving a handful of static files, I took the opportunity to practice with Django. I've got the complete project [hosted on github](https://www.github.com/bmbove/django-simple-homepage "Github - bmbove").

It turns out that Python itself is easy; the syntax forces clean code, and along with some guidelines, makes for very readable source. Without curly braces, parentheses, `=>`, dollar signs, and semi-colons, I probably do half as much typing and can accomplish much more with fewer lines of code. What's been difficult, however, is learning Django. I've never been a fan of frameworks because without years of experience, it's impossible to understand what's going on under the hood. Of course, the whole point of using a framework is that it does the majority of the work for you, resulting in less code needing to be written and faster time to completion. My experience with Django has been like learning a new language altogether- the Python aspect of it is merely syntax. Luckily, I'm improving- I think I only needed to check the Django docs once while coding this site.

With that, I'd like this site to become a platform for some self-improvement in a bunch of areas. In no particular order, here are my goals for this site:

* Learn/Practice Markdown
* Document projects with schematics, pictures, write-ups, videos, etc.
* Put together a professional resume
* Make occasional blog posts on topics that deal with my various hobbies
* Use this site in it's entirety as an addendum to my resume
